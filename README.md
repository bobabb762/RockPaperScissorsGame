# RockPaperScissorsGame
Rock Paper Scissors application

I will be creating a rock paper scissors game in conjunction with the Odin Project curriculum. This will be to test the skills I have learned utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have done a fair bit of study independant of the Odin Project, and will be utilizing those skills as well. As such, I will be making a fully interactive application, not just something that plays in the console. --5-30-22
